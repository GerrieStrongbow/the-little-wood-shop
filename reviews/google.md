> Bought a desk from them. Johan delivered the desk and refused to carry it inside as you cannot expect a 56 year old carpenter to lift it over a gate. Got some guys nearby to help. Never met such a rude person in my life. Didn't bother to dust the desk.

**Howard Stephens** *(Local Guide)* | *3 months ago*

**Andy** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> Beyond expectations. We had a custom table made from a photo we liked. Came out better than expected and Rene delivered it to our place. Brilliant. Thanks again

**Janet Burmeister** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> Such a pleasure to visit this little shop - the most beautiful wooden items - just stunning and simply asking you to run a hand over them. And that lovely real wood smell!

**Brian Taggart** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> Hand crafted furniture in various indigenous timbers. Lots of smaller items, magazine racks, coat hangers, etc. Prices are very reasonable compared to some of the generic furniture retailers in the malls. A Sedgefield gem worth calling in to just look around.

**Greg Cook** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> Johan runs a well organised shop, with a fully equipped workshop at the back. He can pretty much make anything out of wood, from custom bars and office desks, to beautiful furniture. I bought some wood pieces and they are top quality. Nice to meet someone who has such an appreciation and knowledge for wood, grains, types, finishes etc!

**Llewellyn Hern-Joubert** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> The most beautiful wood products. We had a sign custom made, and it was wonderful. There is so much to choose from, and the products are great quality.

**Pierre Fourie** *(Local Guide)* | *a year ago*
> How do I contact this shop? Want to place an order but no reaction on 3 numbers?
